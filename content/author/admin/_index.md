Iâ€™m a Research Fellow in the Conflict Management department at the [Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/). Coming from a diverse background, I am interested in workforce innovation and professional education. I have a specific interest in understanding how we can best educate generalists for an era shaped by autonomous technologies. 

At SAIS, I started the [Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy (CAPS)]( https://github.com/capsseminar/Course-material) short course, teaching early-career policymakers through video games like [StarCraft II](https://github.com/SAIS-S2S-Technology/Roadmap/blob/master/CAPS/CAPS%20syllabus_10-15-18.pdf) and the fictional role of a [Forward Deployed Policy Engineer](https://github.com/capsseminar/Course-material/blob/master/Docs/CAPS-Skills-Course_Syllabus.pdf) about the intersection of human and autonomous decision-making. My other research interests broadly concern organizational decision-making of non-state actors. 

In my spare time, I enjoy learning about product management, especially in education technology. I also like running through Washington, DC and watching StarCraft esports.

I graduated with an M.A. in economics and conflict management from SAIS in May 2019. Before that, I studied comparative literature and philosophy at LMU Munich.
