I am a graduate student in Conflict Management and Economics at the [Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS)](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/). I am interested in technology's potential to advance how humans learn, cooperate and adapt. To supply skills needed to leverage this potential, I started a student-to-student education platform, [SAIS S2S Technology](https://saiss2stechnology.com/).

At SAIS, I also developed and co-teach a short course, [Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy (CAPS)](https://github.com/capsseminar), which explores the fictional role and skill set of a Forward Deployed Policy Engineer. I am grateful that CAPS is mentored by former Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights, [Sarah Sewall](https://kissinger.sais-jhu.edu/sewall.html). In addition, I work as a research assistant for Professor [Sinisa Vukovic](https://www.sais-jhu.edu/sinisa-vukovic) at SAIS and Professor [Brian Gunia](https://carey.jhu.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/brian-gunia-phd/) at Johns Hopkins. Previously, I studied philosophy of language at [LMU Munich](https://www.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/index.html). For a while, I worked as an [actor](https://www.muenchner-kammerspiele.de/inszenierung/mutter-courage-und-ihre-kinder) in German theater.

After graduating from SAIS in May 2019, I plan to continue working on projects that combine technology and global policy and promote an open and stable world.
